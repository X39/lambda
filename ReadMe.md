# FAQ
## What is Lambda?
Lambda is an application which aims to offer a way for anybody to create their own
serverless compute service by deploying lambda services and using lambda for hosting
the executables. 

Lambda can be used to archive high-throughput services at a low cost.

***As of now, it is in a pre-alpha stage and does not offer all features required to
archive that goal.***
